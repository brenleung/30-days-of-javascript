# 30-days-of-javascript
Using Asabeneh's [30 days of JavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript) repo, my answers are listed here.

## Why
As an aspiring frontend developer, I have created two websites that have allowed me to
teach myself the basics of HTML/CSS. Having done this over the past six months, I am
aiming to now learn JavaScript, as I feel this is the next step in becoming a 
frontend developer.

## How
I am aiming to do this over the next 30 days by uploading each day as one file.

## What I Aim to Learn
By the end, I hope to learn the basics of JavaScript in a way that would allow me to
use it in some sort of frontend capacity, whether that be websites, apps, or some
other form.
